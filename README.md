## Description-
This project aims to improve menstrual hygiene and sanitation for females in rural areas. Our main goal is to reduce the usage of cloth, which can cause harmful diseases, by providing a sustainable solution to distribute affordable sanitary pads. This will be facilitated through a simple web dashboard, accessible on basic mobile phones, enabling women to order pads and receive education on menstrual hygiene.

## Theme Fit
- Our project, focusing on menstrual health and hygiene for females in rural areas, fits perfectly within the broader theme of hygiene in rural areas. The website will provide a sustainable solution by connecting users to NGOs, accepting donations, and collecting reviews from women in the form of videos, comments, and audio about pads or any related issues.

## Future Enhancements
#### 1. AI-Powered Review Section: Develop an AI model to automatically translate video and audio reviews into text, making them accessible to all users.
#### 2. Enhanced User Interface: Improve the user interface for better accessibility and user experience.
#### 3. Mobile App Integration: Develop a mobile app to complement the web dashboard, increasing accessibility.
#### 4. Community Engagement: Create forums and discussion boards for women to share their experiences and support each other.
